# The book library

## :warning: This library is in a very early stage

## What is this about?

This library is the first step in building my project "Reading Management System" if you want to know more about this project you can read about it in my [blog post series](https://uaam.hashnode.dev/series/reading-management-system).

I begin with a library because I think that more people and projects could benefit from this. Some use cases besides my project are:

- Create CRUDs for libraries, books stores.
- Implement APIs to get info about books in existing bookstores.
- Create personal book inventories.
- And some more that probably I haven't thought about.

## Help Wanted

As a beginner in Haskell, I'm pretty sure there are things I have done wrong or could be improved, so I appreciate every help you can provide.

Some ways you can help me are:

- Mentorship
- Code contributions
- Domain-based knowledge (Librarians, Authors, Editorial staff, etc.)
- Software design
- Documentation
- Testing
